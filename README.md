# Real-Time Stock Analysis using LSTM

Real-time stock prediction analysis using LSTM is a machine learning technique that forecasts future stock prices based on historical data. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at processing sequential data, such as stock prices.

## Overview

The real-time stock prediction analysis using LSTM involves:
1. Collecting historical stock data
2. Cleaning and processing the data
3. Training an LSTM model on the data
4. Using the trained model to predict future stock prices

These predictions can help investors and traders make informed decisions.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **CPU**: A good CPU is essential.
- **GPU**: A GPU with at least 8GB memory is recommended for training the model.
- **RAM**: At least 8GB of RAM.

### Libraries and Versions

- **Java**: 1.8
- **DeepLearning4J**: 0.9.1
- **ND4J**: 0.9.1
- **Spark**: 2.1.0

## Installation

1. **Download and Extract**: Download the zip file and extract the contents to your desired location.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Maven installed. Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Set Up Alpha Vantage API**:
   Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage and set it in your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Compile and Run**:
   Use Maven to compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.yourpackage.Main"
   ```

2. **Dashboard**:
   If you have a web-based dashboard for visualizing the stock predictions, ensure it's set up and running. (Details of setting this up will depend on the specific dashboard implementation).
